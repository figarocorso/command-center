# COMMAND CENTER
This repos aims to be a self-learning project. Since ages I've felt that I wasn't able to start things from scratch. So here I am facing some of my worst nightmares. Though this repo will evolve throught my deeper fears and thoughts, at the end this repo should contain a dynamic web page to track the current task I'm dealing with. Pomodoro timer, tasklist and some notes. But the features list should grow as I go on the project.

## What is in this repo?
* Frontend
    * Some HTML5 features such as input range or buttons.
    * Some no-so-dynamic CSS styleSHITS
    * Some javascript to load everything around
* Backend
    * A begun-from-scratch PHP REST server
    * Data are stored into a single table in a MySQL database (because yes)
